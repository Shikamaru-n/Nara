# Research on chatbot and the mechanism of chatbot(how it works).
[Chatbot] is short for chatterbot and it is a computer program that is able simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. It is an [Artificial Intelligence (AI)] software that can interact with humans through chat, text or voice command. A chatbot simulates conversation or chat with a user in a natural language through applications like messaging applications, websites, or mobile apps. The chatbot has the ability to make use of backend to give response to requests made by the user. It does this by formulating response to questions in natural language.

[Note:] Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation or imitation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. They are programmed to behave and think like human beings.
## Mechanism of chatbots (how it works).
[The chatbot] is a software that interacts with the user by making use of the back end, Machine Learning, Artificial intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. And the Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of the computer to understand and analyze human speech, find the right response and reply in a way understandable to a human being. 
So the chatbot works by understanding what the user wants through the natural language processing and sending request to the backend (server), and responding back in text or voice simulation.
